## Zoë Idehen

I am a highly motivated, ambitious, hard-working individual transitioning into my desired career path within the tech industry as a Junior Software Developer.

After many years of working as a nurse, I decided to make this career change because I believe that a career in tech is an exciting one without boundaries. I wanted to challenge myself to learn something new that could improve people's lives by solving problems creatively and providing digital products and/or services to individuals to improve their daily lives.

I recently graduated from Makers Academy, a 16-week fully immersive coding skills bootcamp that provided me with a good foundation in software development and programming principles, and I'm looking forward to continue expanding my knowledge and programming skills.

I'm excited to join a friendly, ambitious team that will help me grow and progress as a developer.
